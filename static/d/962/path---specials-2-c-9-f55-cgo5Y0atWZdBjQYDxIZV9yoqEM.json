This isn't an exhaustive list, just some highlights.</p>\n<h2>Developer-friendly API</h2>\n<p>At its core Ghost is a self-consuming, RESTful JSON API with decoupled admin client and front-end. We provide lots of tooling to get a site running as quickly as possible, but at the end of the day it's <strong>Just JSON</strong> ™️, so if you want to use Ghost completely headless and write your own frontend or backend... you can!</p>\n<p>Equally, Ghost is heavily designed for performance. There are 2-5 frontpage stories on HackerNews at any given time that are served by Ghost. It handles scale with ease and doesn't fall over as a result of traffic spikes.</p>\n<h2>A serious editor</h2>\n<p>Ghost has the rich editor which every writer wants, but under the hood it delivers far more power than you would expect. All content is stored in a standardised JSON-based document storage format called MobileDoc, which includes support for extensible rich media objects called Cards.</p>\n<p>In simple terms you can think of it like having Slack integrations inside Medium's editor, stored sanely and fully accessible via API.</p>\n<h2>Custom site structures</h2>\n<p>Routing in Ghost is completely configurable based on your needs. Out of the box Ghost comes with a standard reverse chronological feed of posts with clean permalinks and basic pages, but that's easy to change.</p>\n<p>Whether you need a full <strong>multi-language site</strong> with <code class=\"language-text\">/en/</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">/de/</code> base URLs, or you want to build out specific directory structures for hierarchical data like <code class=\"language-text\">/europe/uk/london/</code> — Ghost's routing layer can be manipulated in any number of ways to achieve your use case.</p>\n<h2>Roles &#x26; permissions</h2>\n<p>Set up your site with sensible user roles and permissions built-in from the start.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contributors:</strong> Can log in and write posts, but cannot publish.</li>\n<li><strong>Authors:</strong> Can create and publish new posts and tags.</li>\n<li><strong>Editors:</strong> Can invite, manage and edit authors and contributors.</li>\n<li><strong>Administrators:</strong> Have full permissions to edit all data and settings.</li>\n<li><strong>Owner:</strong> An admin who cannot be deleted + has access to billing details.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Custom themes</h2>\n<p>Ghost ships with a simple Handlebars.js front-end theme layer which is very straightforward to work with and surprisingly powerful. Many people stick with the default theme (<a href=\"https://demo.ghost.io\">live demo</a> / <a href=\"https://github.com/tryghost/casper\">source code</a>), which provides a clean magazine design - but this can be modified or entirely replaced.</p>\n<p>The Ghost <a href=\"https://marketplace.ghost.org\">Theme Marketplace</a> provides a selection of pre-made third-party themes which can be installed with ease. Of course you can also build your own <a href=\"/api/handlebars-themes/\">Handlebars Theme</a> or use a <a href=\"/api/\">different front-end</a> altogether.</p>\n<h2>Apps &#x26; integrations</h2>\n<p>Because Ghost is completely open source, built as a JSON API, has webhooks, and gives you full control over the front-end: It essentially integrates with absolutely everything. Some things are easier than others, but almost anything is possible with a little elbow grease. Or a metaphor more recent than 1803.</p>\n<p>You can browse our large <a href=\"/integrations/\">directory of integrations</a> with instructions, or build any manner of custom integration yourself by writing a little JavaScript and Markup to do whatever you want.</p>\n<p>You don't need janky broken plugins which slow your site down. Integrations are the modern way to achieve extended functionality with ease.</p>\n<h2>Search engine optimisation</h2>\n<p>Ghost comes with world-class SEO and everything you need to ensure that your content shows up in search indexes quickly and consistently.</p>\n<h4>No plugins needed</h4>\n<p>Ghost has all the fundamental technical SEO optimisations built directly into core, without any need to rely on third party plugins. It also has a far superior speed and pageload performance thanks to Node.js.</p>\n<h4>Automatic google XML sitemaps</h4>\n<p>Ghost will automatically generate and link to a complete Google sitemap including every page on your site, to make sure search engines are able to index every URL.</p>\n<h4>Automatic structured data + JSON-LD</h4>\n<p>Ghost generates <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data\">JSON-LD</a> based structured metadata about your pages so that you don't have to rely on messy microformats in your markup to provide semantic context. Even if you change theme or front-end, your SEO remains perfectly intact. Ghost also adds automatic code for Facebook OpenGraph and Twitter Cards.</p>\n<h4>Canonical tags</h4>\n<p>Ghost automatically generates the correct <code class=\"language-text\">rel=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> tag for each post and page so that search engines always prioritise one true link.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you're curious to see more, check out the <a href=\"https://ghost.org/features/\">features page</a> on Ghost.org.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-10-15","path":"/post-one","title":"Post Number One","tags":["C++","设计模式"],"type":"resource","typeID":"3","typeTitle":"资源","categores":"游戏","special":""}}},{"node":{"id":"2c4d5f7b-294d-5bdb-b31d-ec40e91929b8","excerpt":"Ghost is an open source, professional publishing platform built on a modern Node.js technology stack — designed for teams who need power, flexibility and performance.

Ghost provides the best of both worlds, and more.</p>\n<p>Still after a more detailed comparison? We've got some in-depth articles comparing Ghost to <a href=\"https://ghost.org/vs/wordpress/\">WordPress</a>, <a href=\"https://ghost.org/vs/medium/\">Medium</a> and <a href=\"https://ghost.org/vs/tumblr/\">Tumblr</a>.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Ghost was created by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnonolan\">John O'Nolan</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/erisds\">Hannah Wolfe</a> in 2013 following a runaway Kickstarter campaign to create a new, modern publishing platform to serve professional publishers.</p>\n<p>Previously, John was a core contributor of WordPress and watched as the platform grew more complicated and less focused over time. Ghost started out as a little idea to be the antidote to that pain, and quickly grew in popularity as the demand for a modern open source solution became evident.</p>\n<p>Today, Ghost is one of the most popular open source projects in the world - the <strong>#1</strong> CMS <a href=\"https://github.com/tryghost/ghost\">on GitHub</a> - and is used in production by millions of people. </p>\n<p>More than anything, we approach building Ghost to create the product we've always wanted to use, the company we've always wanted to do business with, and the environment we've always wanted to work in. </p>\n<p>So, we do things a little differently to most others:</p>\n<h4>Independent structure</h4>\n<p>Ghost is structured as a <a href=\"https://ghost.org/about\">non-profit organisation</a> to ensure it can legally never be sold and will always remain independent, building products based on the needs of its users - <em>not</em> the whims of investors looking for 💰 returns.</p>\n<h4>Sustainable business</h4>\n<p>While the software we release is free, we also sell <a href=\"https://ghost.org/pricing/\">premium managed hosting</a> for it, which gives the non-profit organisation a sustainable business model and allows it to be 100% self-funded.</p>\n<h4>Distributed team</h4>\n<p>Having a sustainable business allows us to hire open source contributors to work on Ghost full-time, and we do this <a href=\"https://ghost.org/about/#careers\">entirely remotely</a>. The core Ghost team is fully distributed and live wherever they choose.</p>\n<h4>Transparent by default</h4>\n<p>We share <a href=\"https://ghost.org/about\">our revenue</a> transparently and <a href=\"https://github.com/tryghost\">our code</a> openly so anyone can verify what we do and how we do it. No cloaks or daggers. </p>\n<h4>Unconditional open source</h4>\n<p>All our projects are released under the permissive open source <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License\">MIT licence</a>, so that even if the company were to fail, our code could still be picked up and carried on by anyone in the world without restriction.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-10-16","path":"/post-two","title":"Post Number Two","tags":["JavaScript","Html5"],"type":"resource","typeID":"3","typeTitle":"资源","categores":"Web","special":""}}},{"node":{"id":"3f488da6-4175-5c0c-bcab-c8ac103f80f2","excerpt":"Staff users within Ghost have access to the admin area with varying levels of permissions for what they can do.

Multiple authors can be assigned to any given post to generate bylines. Equally, author archives can be generated on the front end based on which posts an author is assigned to.</p>\n<p>Also like tags, within Ghost Handlebars Themes author archives are automatically added to the Google XML Sitemap, and have their own pagination + RSS feeds.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of an <a href=\"https://demo.ghost.io/author/martin/\">author archive</a> in the default Ghost Theme:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://demo.ghost.io/author/martin/\"><img src=\"../images/concepts/author-archive.jpg\" alt=\"Author Archive\"></a></p>\n<p>Public author archives are only generated for staff users who are assigned to published posts, any other staff users are not publicly visible.</p>\n<h2>Security &#x26; trust</h2>\n<p>If running the front-end of your site and the Ghost admin client on the same domain, there are certain permissions escalation vectors which are unavoidable.</p>\n<p>Ghost considers staff users to be \"trusted\" by default - so if you're running in an environment where users are untrusted, you should ensure that Ghost-Admin and your site's front-end run on separate domains.</p>\n<h2>Sample API data</h2>\n<p>Here's a sample author object from the Ghost <a href=\"/api/content/\">Content API</a></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\">user<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"id\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"1239bbfe90a518a862677abc\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"name\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Cameron Almeida\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"slug\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"cameron-almeida\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"url\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"https://path.to/author/cameron-almeida/\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"bio\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Editor at large.\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"location\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Cape Town\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"profile_image\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"https://path.to/img.png\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"website\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"https://example.com\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"twitter\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"https://twitter.com/example\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"facebook\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"https://facebook.com/example\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"cover_image\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token null\">null</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"meta_title\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token null\">null</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"meta_description\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token null\">null</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-10-17","path":"/post-three","title":"Post Number Three","tags":["Html5","WebGL"],"type":"self","typeID":"1","typeTitle":"个人随笔","categores":"个人日记","special":""}}},{"node":{"id":"6eaf8d9b-2f0b-58e3-bc3c-f6bd9f537d1c","excerpt":"For self-hosted Ghost users, a custom configuration file can be used to override Ghost's default behaviour.

This provides you with a range of options to configure your publication to suit your needs.</p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>When you install Ghost using the supported and recommended method using <code class=\"language-text\">ghost-cli</code>, a custom configuration file is created for you by default. There are some configuration options which are required by default, and many optional configurations.</p>\n<p>The three required options are <code class=\"language-text\">url</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">database</code> which are configured during setup, and <code class=\"language-text\">mail</code> which needs to be configured once you've installed Ghost.</p>\n<p>This article explains how to setup your mail config, as well as walk you through all of the available config options.</p>\n<h2>Custom configuration files</h2>\n<p>The configuration is managed by <a href=\"https://github.com/indexzero/nconf/\">nconf</a>. A custom configuration file must be a valid JSON file located in the root folder and changes to the file can be implemented using <code class=\"language-text\">ghost restart</code>.</p>\n<p>Since Node.js has the concept of environments built in, Ghost supports two environments: <strong>development</strong> and <strong>production</strong>. All public Ghost publications run in production mode, while development mode can be used to test or build on top of Ghost locally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Check out the official install guides for <a href=\"/install/local/\">development</a> and <a href=\"/install/ubuntu/\">production</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The configuration files reflect the environment you are using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">config.development.json</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">config.production.json</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Ghost in development</h4>\n<p>If you would like to start Ghost in development, you don't have to specify any environment, because development is default. To test Ghost in production, you can use:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">NODE_ENV<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>production node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h4>Debugging the configuration output</h4>\n<p>Start Ghost with:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">DEBUG<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>ghost:*,ghost-config node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h4>Running Ghost with config env variables</h4>\n<p>Start Ghost using environment variables which match the name and case of each config option:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">url<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>http://ghost.local:2368 node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<p>For nested config options, separate with two underscores:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">database__connection__host<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>mysql node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Configuration options</h2>\n<p>There are a number of configuration options which are explained in detail in this article.

When installing using <code class=\"language-text\">ghost-cli</code> the install process request the URL during the setup process.</p>\n<p>Enter the URL that is used to access your publication. If using a subpath, enter the full path, <code class=\"language-text\">https://example.com/blog/</code>. If using SSL, always enter the URL with <code class=\"language-text\">https://</code>.</p>\n<h4>SSL</h4>\n<p>We always recommend using SSL to run your Ghost publication in production. Ghost has a number of configuration options for working with SSL, and securing the URLs for the admin <code class=\"language-text\">/ghost/</code> and the frontend of your publication. Without SSL your username and password are sent in plaintext.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ghost-cli</code> prompts to setup SSL during the installation process. After a successful ssl setup, you can find your ssl certificate in <code class=\"language-text\">/etc/letsencrypt</code>.</p>\n<p>If you see errors such as <code class=\"language-text\">access denied from url</code>, then the provided URL in your config file is incorrect and needs to be updated.</p>\n<h3>Database</h3>\n<p><em>(Required in production)</em></p>\n<p>Ghost is configured using MySQL by default:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"mysql\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"127.0.0.1\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">3306</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_user\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"password\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_password\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_name\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Alternatively you can configure sqlite3:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"sqlite3\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"filename\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"content/data/ghost-test.db\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"useNullAsDefault\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"debug\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>Number of connections</h4>\n<p>It's possible to limit the number of simultaneous connections using the pool setting. The default values are a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 10, which means Ghost always maintains two active database connections.

With cloud computing and database-as-a-service providers you might want to enable SSL connections to the database.</p>\n<p>If your Certificate CA or the CA of your database provider is in the Mozilla trusted CA list you can enable SSL by adding <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;ssl&quot;: true</code> to the database connection configuration:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"mysql\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_cloud_database\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">3306</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_user\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"password\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_password\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_name\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"ssl\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This has been confirmed to work with Azure Database for MySQL.

Mail configuration allows Ghost to send emails such as lost password and user invite emails.</p>\n<p>Ghost uses <a href=\"https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/tree/0.7/\">Nodemailer 0.7</a> under the hood, and tries to use the direct mail service if available - but a more reliable solution is to setup mail using an external service.</p>\n<h4>Setup an email sending account</h4>\n<p>Choose an external email service and sign up and verify your account. We highly recommend using <a href=\"https://www.mailgun.com/\">Mailgun</a> which allows up to 10,000 emails per month for free.</p>\n<h4>Configure mail with Mailgun</h4>\n<p>Mailgun allows you to use your own domain for sending transactional emails. Otherwise you can use a subdomain that Mailgun provide you with (also known as the sandbox domain, limited to 300 emails per day). You can change this at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>Make a note of your domain information</strong></p>\n<p>Once your domain is setup, find your new email service SMTP username and password that has been created for you (this is not the ones you used to sign up for Mailgun with). You can find this under \"Domain Information\" and make a note of the following details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Default SMTP login</li>\n<li>Default password</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Update your <code class=\"language-text\">config.production.json</code> file</h4>\n<p>Open your production config file in any code editor and paste the username and password you just copied into the defined fields, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"transport\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SMTP\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"options\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"service\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Mailgun\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"auth\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"postmaster@example.mailgun.org\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"pass\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"1234567890\"</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Once you are finished, hit save and then run <code class=\"language-text\">restart ghost</code> for your changes to take effect. It is possible to reuse your settings for a development environment if you have both, by making the same changes to <code class=\"language-text\">config.development.json</code>.</p>\n<h4>Amazon SES</h4>\n<p>It's also possible to use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ses/\">Amazon Simple Email Service</a>. Use the SMTP username and password given when signing up and configure your <code class=\"language-text\">config.[env].json</code> file as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"transport\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SMTP\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"options\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-SERVER-NAME\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">465</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"service\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SES\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"auth\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-ACCESS-KEY-ID\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"pass\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY\"</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>From address</h4>\n<p>By default the 'from' address for mail sent from Ghost is set to the title of your publication, for example <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;ghost@your-publication.com&gt;</code>. To override this to something different, use:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"from\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"myemail@address.com\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>A custom name can also be provided:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"from\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"'Custom Name' &lt;myemail@address.com>\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>Admin URL</h3>\n<p>Admin can be used to specify a different protocol for your admin panel or a different hostname (domain name).

To use a content directory that does not live inside the Ghost folder, specify a paths object with a new contentPath:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"paths\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"contentPath\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"content/\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>When using a custom content path, the content directory must exist and contain sub directories for data, images, themes, logs and adapters.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If using an Sqlite database, you'll also need to update the path to your database to match the new location of the data folder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Referrer Policy</h3>\n<p>Set the value of the content attribute of the meta referrer HTML tag by adding referrerPolicy to your config. <code class=\"language-text\">origin-when-crossorigin</code> is default. Read through all possible <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy/#referrer-policies/\">options</a>.</p>\n<h3>Logging</h3>\n<p>Configure how Ghost should log, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"logging\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"path\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"something/\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"level\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"info\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"rotation\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"enabled\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"count\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"period\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"1d\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"transports\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"stdout\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"file\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">level</code></h4>\n<p>The default log level is <code class=\"language-text\">info</code> which prints all info, warning and error logs. Set it to <code class=\"language-text\">error</code> to only print errors.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">rotation</code></h4>\n<p>Tell Ghost to rotate your log files. By default Ghost keeps 10 log files and rotates every day. Rotation is enabled by default in production and disabled in development.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">transports</code></h4>\n<p>Define where Ghost should log to. By default Ghost writes to stdout and into file for production, and to stdout only for development.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">path</code></h4>\n<p>Log your content path, e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">content/logs/</code>.

This isn't an exhaustive list, just some highlights.</p>\n<h2>Developer-friendly API</h2>\n<p>At its core Ghost is a self-consuming, RESTful JSON API with decoupled admin client and front-end. We provide lots of tooling to get a site running as quickly as possible, but at the end of the day it's <strong>Just JSON</strong> ™️, so if you want to use Ghost completely headless and write your own frontend or backend... you can!</p>\n<p>Equally, Ghost is heavily designed for performance. There are 2-5 frontpage stories on HackerNews at any given time that are served by Ghost. It handles scale with ease and doesn't fall over as a result of traffic spikes.</p>\n<h2>A serious editor</h2>\n<p>Ghost has the rich editor which every writer wants, but under the hood it delivers far more power than you would expect. All content is stored in a standardised JSON-based document storage format called MobileDoc, which includes support for extensible rich media objects called Cards.</p>\n<p>In simple terms you can think of it like having Slack integrations inside Medium's editor, stored sanely and fully accessible via API.</p>\n<h2>Custom site structures</h2>\n<p>Routing in Ghost is completely configurable based on your needs. Out of the box Ghost comes with a standard reverse chronological feed of posts with clean permalinks and basic pages, but that's easy to change.</p>\n<p>Whether you need a full <strong>multi-language site</strong> with <code class=\"language-text\">/en/</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">/de/</code> base URLs, or you want to build out specific directory structures for hierarchical data like <code class=\"language-text\">/europe/uk/london/</code> — Ghost's routing layer can be manipulated in any number of ways to achieve your use case.</p>\n<h2>Roles &#x26; permissions</h2>\n<p>Set up your site with sensible user roles and permissions built-in from the start.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contributors:</strong> Can log in and write posts, but cannot publish.</li>\n<li><strong>Authors:</strong> Can create and publish new posts and tags.</li>\n<li><strong>Editors:</strong> Can invite, manage and edit authors and contributors.</li>\n<li><strong>Administrators:</strong> Have full permissions to edit all data and settings.</li>\n<li><strong>Owner:</strong> An admin who cannot be deleted + has access to billing details.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Custom themes</h2>\n<p>Ghost ships with a simple Handlebars.js front-end theme layer which is very straightforward to work with and surprisingly powerful. Many people stick with the default theme (<a href=\"https://demo.ghost.io\">live demo</a> / <a href=\"https://github.com/tryghost/casper\">source code</a>), which provides a clean magazine design - but this can be modified or entirely replaced.</p>\n<p>The Ghost <a href=\"https://marketplace.ghost.org\">Theme Marketplace</a> provides a selection of pre-made third-party themes which can be installed with ease. Of course you can also build your own <a href=\"/api/handlebars-themes/\">Handlebars Theme</a> or use a <a href=\"/api/\">different front-end</a> altogether.</p>\n<h2>Apps &#x26; integrations</h2>\n<p>Because Ghost is completely open source, built as a JSON API, has webhooks, and gives you full control over the front-end: It essentially integrates with absolutely everything. Some things are easier than others, but almost anything is possible with a little elbow grease. Or a metaphor more recent than 1803.</p>\n<p>You can browse our large <a href=\"/integrations/\">directory of integrations</a> with instructions, or build any manner of custom integration yourself by writing a little JavaScript and Markup to do whatever you want.</p>\n<p>You don't need janky broken plugins which slow your site down. Integrations are the modern way to achieve extended functionality with ease.</p>\n<h2>Search engine optimisation</h2>\n<p>Ghost comes with world-class SEO and everything you need to ensure that your content shows up in search indexes quickly and consistently.</p>\n<h4>No plugins needed</h4>\n<p>Ghost has all the fundamental technical SEO optimisations built directly into core, without any need to rely on third party plugins. It also has a far superior speed and pageload performance thanks to Node.js.</p>\n<h4>Automatic google XML sitemaps</h4>\n<p>Ghost will automatically generate and link to a complete Google sitemap including every page on your site, to make sure search engines are able to index every URL.</p>\n<h4>Automatic structured data + JSON-LD</h4>\n<p>Ghost generates <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data\">JSON-LD</a> based structured metadata about your pages so that you don't have to rely on messy microformats in your markup to provide semantic context. Even if you change theme or front-end, your SEO remains perfectly intact. Ghost also adds automatic code for Facebook OpenGraph and Twitter Cards.</p>\n<h4>Canonical tags</h4>\n<p>Ghost automatically generates the correct <code class=\"language-text\">rel=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> tag for each post and page so that search engines always prioritise one true link.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you're curious to see more, check out the <a href=\"https://ghost.org/features/\">features page</a> on Ghost.org.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-10-19","path":"/post-five","title":"Post Number Five","tags":["Html5","JavaScript","WebGL"],"type":"dev","typeID":"2","typeTitle":"技术杂谈","categores":"Web","special":"JavaWeb开发系列"}}},{"node":{"id":"8ea8b142-e66e-5e8c-8f86-1b82e12c9ba4","excerpt":"Ghost is an open source, professional publishing platform built on a modern Node.js technology stack — designed for teams who need power, flexibility and performance.

There are some configuration options which are required by default, and many optional configurations.</p>\n<p>The three required options are <code class=\"language-text\">url</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">database</code> which are configured during setup, and <code class=\"language-text\">mail</code> which needs to be configured once you've installed Ghost.</p>\n<p>This article explains how to setup your mail config, as well as walk you through all of the available config options.</p>\n<h2>Custom configuration files</h2>\n<p>The configuration is managed by <a href=\"https://github.com/indexzero/nconf/\">nconf</a>. A custom configuration file must be a valid JSON file located in the root folder and changes to the file can be implemented using <code class=\"language-text\">ghost restart</code>.</p>\n<p>Since Node.js has the concept of environments built in, Ghost supports two environments: <strong>development</strong> and <strong>production</strong>. All public Ghost publications run in production mode, while development mode can be used to test or build on top of Ghost locally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Check out the official install guides for <a href=\"/install/local/\">development</a> and <a href=\"/install/ubuntu/\">production</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The configuration files reflect the environment you are using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">config.development.json</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">config.production.json</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Ghost in development</h4>\n<p>If you would like to start Ghost in development, you don't have to specify any environment, because development is default. To test Ghost in production, you can use:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">NODE_ENV<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>production node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h4>Debugging the configuration output</h4>\n<p>Start Ghost with:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">DEBUG<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>ghost:*,ghost-config node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h4>Running Ghost with config env variables</h4>\n<p>Start Ghost using environment variables which match the name and case of each config option:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">url<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>http://ghost.local:2368 node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<p>For nested config options, separate with two underscores:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">database__connection__host<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>mysql node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Configuration options</h2>\n<p>There are a number of configuration options which are explained in detail in this article. Below is an index of all configuration options:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Required?</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">url</code></td>\n<td>In production</td>\n<td>Set the public URL for your blog</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">database</code></td>\n<td>In production</td>\n<td>Type of databased used (default: sqlite3)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">mail</code></td>\n<td>In production</td>\n<td>Add a mail service</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">admin</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Set the protocol and hostname for your admin panel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">server</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Host and port, or socket for Ghost to listen on</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">privacy</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Disable features set in <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/PRIVACY.md/\">privacy.md</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">paths</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Customise internal paths</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">referrerPolicy</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Control the content attribute of the meta referrer tag</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">useMinFiles</code></td>\n<td>Optionl</td>\n<td>Generate assets url with .min notation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">storage</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Set a custom storage adapter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">scheduling</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Set a custom scheduling adapter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">logging</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure logging for Ghost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">spam</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure spam settings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">caching</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure caching settings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">compress</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Disable compression of server responses</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">imageOptimization</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure image manipulation and processing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>URL</h3>\n<p><em>(Required in production)</em></p>\n<p>Once a Ghost publication is installed, the first thing to do is set a url. When installing using <code class=\"language-text\">ghost-cli</code> the install process request the URL during the setup process.</p>\n<p>Enter the URL that is used to access your publication. If using a subpath, enter the full path, <code class=\"language-text\">https://example.com/blog/</code>. If using SSL, always enter the URL with <code class=\"language-text\">https://</code>.</p>\n<h4>SSL</h4>\n<p>We always recommend using SSL to run your Ghost publication in production. Ghost has a number of configuration options for working with SSL, and securing the URLs for the admin <code class=\"language-text\">/ghost/</code> and the frontend of your publication. Without SSL your username and password are sent in plaintext.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ghost-cli</code> prompts to setup SSL during the installation process. After a successful ssl setup, you can find your ssl certificate in <code class=\"language-text\">/etc/letsencrypt</code>.</p>\n<p>If you see errors such as <code class=\"language-text\">access denied from url</code>, then the provided URL in your config file is incorrect and needs to be updated.</p>\n<h3>Database</h3>\n<p><em>(Required in production)</em></p>\n<p>Ghost is configured using MySQL by default:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"mysql\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"127.0.0.1\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">3306</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_user\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"password\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_password\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_name\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Alternatively you can configure sqlite3:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"sqlite3\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"filename\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"content/data/ghost-test.db\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"useNullAsDefault\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"debug\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>Number of connections</h4>\n<p>It's possible to limit the number of simultaneous connections using the pool setting. The default values are a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 10, which means Ghost always maintains two active database connections.

Mail configuration allows Ghost to send emails such as lost password and user invite emails.</p>\n<p>Ghost uses <a href=\"https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/tree/0.7/\">Nodemailer 0.7</a> under the hood, and tries to use the direct mail service if available - but a more reliable solution is to setup mail using an external service.</p>\n<h4>Setup an email sending account</h4>\n<p>Choose an external email service and sign up and verify your account. We highly recommend using <a href=\"https://www.mailgun.com/\">Mailgun</a> which allows up to 10,000 emails per month for free.</p>\n<h4>Configure mail with Mailgun</h4>\n<p>Mailgun allows you to use your own domain for sending transactional emails. Otherwise you can use a subdomain that Mailgun provide you with (also known as the sandbox domain, limited to 300 emails per day). You can change this at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>Make a note of your domain information</strong></p>\n<p>Once your domain is setup, find your new email service SMTP username and password that has been created for you (this is not the ones you used to sign up for Mailgun with). You can find this under \"Domain Information\" and make a note of the following details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Default SMTP login</li>\n<li>Default password</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Update your <code class=\"language-text\">config.production.json</code> file</h4>\n<p>Open your production config file in any code editor and paste the username and password you just copied into the defined fields, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"transport\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SMTP\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"options\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"service\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Mailgun\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"auth\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"postmaster@example.mailgun.org\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"pass\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"1234567890\"</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Once you are finished, hit save and then run <code class=\"language-text\">restart ghost</code> for your changes to take effect. It is possible to reuse your settings for a development environment if you have both, by making the same changes to <code class=\"language-text\">config.development.json</code>.</p>\n<h4>Amazon SES</h4>\n<p>It's also possible to use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ses/\">Amazon Simple Email Service</a>. Use the SMTP username and password given when signing up and configure your <code class=\"language-text\">config.[env].json</code> file as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"transport\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SMTP\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"options\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-SERVER-NAME\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">465</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"service\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SES\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"auth\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-ACCESS-KEY-ID\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"pass\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY\"</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>From address</h4>\n<p>By default the 'from' address for mail sent from Ghost is set to the title of your publication, for example <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;ghost@your-publication.com&gt;</code>. To override this to something different, use:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"from\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"myemail@address.com\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>A custom name can also be provided:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"from\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"'Custom Name' &lt;myemail@address.com>\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>Admin URL</h3>\n<p>Admin can be used to specify a different protocol for your admin panel or a different hostname (domain name).

By default, requests are routed from port 80 to Ghost by nginx (recommended), or apache.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"server\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"127.0.0.1\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">2368</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>Unix Sockets</h4>\n<p>Ghost can also be configured to listen on a unix socket by changing the server config:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"server\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"socket\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"path/to/socket.sock\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The default permissions are 0660, but this can be configured by expanding the socket config:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"server\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"socket\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"path\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"path/to/socket.sock\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"permissions\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"0666\"</span>\n   <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>Privacy</h3>\n<p>All features inside the privacy.md file are enabled by default. It is possible to turn these off in order to protect privacy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update check</li>\n<li>Gravatar</li>\n<li>RPC ping</li>\n<li>Structured data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information about the features, read the <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/PRIVACY.md/\">privacy.md page</a>.</p>\n<p>To turn off <strong>all</strong> of the features, use:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"privacy\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"useTinfoil\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Alternatively, configure each feature individually:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"privacy\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"useUpdateCheck\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"useGravatar\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"useRpcPing\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"useStructuredData\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>Paths</h3>\n<p>The configuration of paths can be relative or absolute. To use a content directory that does not live inside the Ghost folder, specify a paths object with a new contentPath:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"paths\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"contentPath\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"content/\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>When using a custom content path, the content directory must exist and contain sub directories for data, images, themes, logs and adapters.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If using an Sqlite database, you'll also need to update the path to your database to match the new location of the data folder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Referrer Policy</h3>\n<p>Set the value of the content attribute of the meta referrer HTML tag by adding referrerPolicy to your config. <code class=\"language-text\">origin-when-crossorigin</code> is default. Read through all possible <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy/#referrer-policies/\">options</a>.</p>\n<h3>Logging</h3>\n<p>Configure how Ghost should log, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"logging\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"path\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"something/\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"level\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"info\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"rotation\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"enabled\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"count\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"period\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"1d\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"transports\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"stdout\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"file\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">level</code></h4>\n<p>The default log level is <code class=\"language-text\">info</code> which prints all info, warning and error logs. Set it to <code class=\"language-text\">error</code> to only print errors.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">rotation</code></h4>\n<p>Tell Ghost to rotate your log files. By default Ghost keeps 10 log files and rotates every day. Rotation is enabled by default in production and disabled in development.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">transports</code></h4>\n<p>Define where Ghost should log to. By default Ghost writes to stdout and into file for production, and to stdout only for development.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">path</code></h4>\n<p>Log your content path, e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">content/logs/</code>. Set any path but ensure the permissions are correct to write into this folder.</p>\n<h3>Spam</h3>\n<p>Tell Ghost how to treat <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/config/defaults.json#L31\">spam requests</a>.</p>\n<h3>Caching</h3>\n<p>Configure <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/config/defaults.json#L57/\">caching</a> for sitemaps, redirects or assets.</p>\n<h3>Compress</h3>\n<p>The compression flag is turned on by default using <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;compress&quot;: true</code>. Alternatively you can turn it off with <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;compress&quot;: false</code>.</p>\n<h3>Image optimisation</h3>\n<p>When uploading images into the Ghost editor, they are automatically processed and compressed by default. This can be disabled in your <code class=\"language-text\">config.[env].json</code> file using:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"imageOptimization\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"resize\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Image compression details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resize the image to 2000px max width</li>\n<li>JPEG's are compressed to 80% quality.</li>\n<li>Meta data removed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The original image is kept with the suffix <code class=\"language-text\">_0</code>.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>You've explored how to configure a self-hosted Ghost publication with the required config options, as well as discovered how to make use of the optional config options that are available in the <code class=\"language-text\">config.[env].json</code> file.</p>\n<p>If you run into any issues when configuring your publication, try searching this site to find information about common error messages and issues.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-11-20","path":"/post-11-20","title":"Post 11 20","tags":["DirectX 12","C++"],"type":"dev","typeID":"2","typeTitle":"技术杂谈","categores":"DirectX 12","special":"Unreal Engine 4系列"}}},{"node":{"id":"9ab37380-4622-525d-968f-bb7829583675","excerpt":"Overview When you install Ghost using the supported and recommended method using  , a custom configuration file is created for you by default.

To test Ghost in production, you can use:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">NODE_ENV<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>production node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h4>Debugging the configuration output</h4>\n<p>Start Ghost with:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">DEBUG<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>ghost:*,ghost-config node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h4>Running Ghost with config env variables</h4>\n<p>Start Ghost using environment variables which match the name and case of each config option:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">url<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>http://ghost.local:2368 node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<p>For nested config options, separate with two underscores:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">database__connection__host<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>mysql node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Configuration options</h2>\n<p>There are a number of configuration options which are explained in detail in this article. Below is an index of all configuration options:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Required?</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">url</code></td>\n<td>In production</td>\n<td>Set the public URL for your blog</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">database</code></td>\n<td>In production</td>\n<td>Type of databased used (default: sqlite3)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">mail</code></td>\n<td>In production</td>\n<td>Add a mail service</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">admin</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Set the protocol and hostname for your admin panel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">server</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Host and port, or socket for Ghost to listen on</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">privacy</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Disable features set in <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/PRIVACY.md/\">privacy.md</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">paths</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Customise internal paths</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">referrerPolicy</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Control the content attribute of the meta referrer tag</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">useMinFiles</code></td>\n<td>Optionl</td>\n<td>Generate assets url with .min notation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">storage</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Set a custom storage adapter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">scheduling</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Set a custom scheduling adapter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">logging</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure logging for Ghost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">spam</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure spam settings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">caching</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure caching settings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">compress</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Disable compression of server responses</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">imageOptimization</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure image manipulation and processing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>URL</h3>\n<p><em>(Required in production)</em></p>\n<p>Once a Ghost publication is installed, the first thing to do is set a url. When installing using <code class=\"language-text\">ghost-cli</code> the install process request the URL during the setup process.</p>\n<p>Enter the URL that is used to access your publication. If using a subpath, enter the full path, <code class=\"language-text\">https://example.com/blog/</code>. If using SSL, always enter the URL with <code class=\"language-text\">https://</code>.</p>\n<h4>SSL</h4>\n<p>We always recommend using SSL to run your Ghost publication in production. Ghost has a number of configuration options for working with SSL, and securing the URLs for the admin <code class=\"language-text\">/ghost/</code> and the frontend of your publication. Without SSL your username and password are sent in plaintext.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ghost-cli</code> prompts to setup SSL during the installation process. After a successful ssl setup, you can find your ssl certificate in <code class=\"language-text\">/etc/letsencrypt</code>.</p>\n<p>If you see errors such as <code class=\"language-text\">access denied from url</code>, then the provided URL in your config file is incorrect and needs to be updated.</p>\n<h3>Database</h3>\n<p><em>(Required in production)</em></p>\n<p>Ghost is configured using MySQL by default:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"mysql\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"127.0.0.1\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">3306</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_user\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"password\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_password\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_name\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Alternatively you can configure sqlite3:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"sqlite3\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"filename\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"content/data/ghost-test.db\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"useNullAsDefault\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"debug\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>Number of connections</h4>\n<p>It's possible to limit the number of simultaneous connections using the pool setting. The default values are a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 10, which means Ghost always maintains two active database connections. You can set the minimum to 0 to prevent this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> ...<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> ... <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"pool\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"min\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"max\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">20</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>SSL</h4>\n<p>In a typical Ghost installation the MySQL database will be on the same server as Ghost itself. With cloud computing and database-as-a-service providers you might want to enable SSL connections to the database.</p>\n<p>If your Certificate CA or the CA of your database provider is in the Mozilla trusted CA list you can enable SSL by adding <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;ssl&quot;: true</code> to the database connection configuration:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"mysql\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_cloud_database\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">3306</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_user\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"password\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_password\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_name\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"ssl\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This has been confirmed to work with Azure Database for MySQL.

Mail configuration allows Ghost to send emails such as lost password and user invite emails.</p>\n<p>Ghost uses <a href=\"https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/tree/0.7/\">Nodemailer 0.7</a> under the hood, and tries to use the direct mail service if available - but a more reliable solution is to setup mail using an external service.</p>\n<h4>Setup an email sending account</h4>\n<p>Choose an external email service and sign up and verify your account. We highly recommend using <a href=\"https://www.mailgun.com/\">Mailgun</a> which allows up to 10,000 emails per month for free.</p>\n<h4>Configure mail with Mailgun</h4>\n<p>Mailgun allows you to use your own domain for sending transactional emails. Otherwise you can use a subdomain that Mailgun provide you with (also known as the sandbox domain, limited to 300 emails per day). You can change this at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>Make a note of your domain information</strong></p>\n<p>Once your domain is setup, find your new email service SMTP username and password that has been created for you (this is not the ones you used to sign up for Mailgun with). You can find this under \"Domain Information\" and make a note of the following details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Default SMTP login</li>\n<li>Default password</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Update your <code class=\"language-text\">config.production.json</code> file</h4>\n<p>Open your production config file in any code editor and paste the username and password you just copied into the defined fields, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"transport\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SMTP\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"options\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"service\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Mailgun\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"auth\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"postmaster@example.mailgun.org\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"pass\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"1234567890\"</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Once you are finished, hit save and then run <code class=\"language-text\">restart ghost</code> for your changes to take effect. It is possible to reuse your settings for a development environment if you have both, by making the same changes to <code class=\"language-text\">config.development.json</code>.</p>\n<h4>Amazon SES</h4>\n<p>It's also possible to use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ses/\">Amazon Simple Email Service</a>. Use the SMTP username and password given when signing up and configure your <code class=\"language-text\">config.[env].json</code> file as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"transport\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SMTP\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"options\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-SERVER-NAME\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">465</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"service\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SES\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"auth\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-ACCESS-KEY-ID\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"pass\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY\"</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>From address</h4>\n<p>By default the 'from' address for mail sent from Ghost is set to the title of your publication, for example <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;ghost@your-publication.com&gt;</code>. To override this to something different, use:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"from\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"myemail@address.com\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>A custom name can also be provided:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"from\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"'Custom Name' &lt;myemail@address.com>\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>Admin URL</h3>\n<p>Admin can be used to specify a different protocol for your admin panel or a different hostname (domain name).

To use a content directory that does not live inside the Ghost folder, specify a paths object with a new contentPath:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"paths\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"contentPath\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"content/\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>When using a custom content path, the content directory must exist and contain sub directories for data, images, themes, logs and adapters.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If using an Sqlite database, you'll also need to update the path to your database to match the new location of the data folder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Referrer Policy</h3>\n<p>Set the value of the content attribute of the meta referrer HTML tag by adding referrerPolicy to your config. <code class=\"language-text\">origin-when-crossorigin</code> is default. Read through all possible <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy/#referrer-policies/\">options</a>.</p>\n<h3>Logging</h3>\n<p>Configure how Ghost should log, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"logging\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"path\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"something/\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"level\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"info\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"rotation\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"enabled\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"count\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"period\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"1d\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"transports\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"stdout\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"file\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">level</code></h4>\n<p>The default log level is <code class=\"language-text\">info</code> which prints all info, warning and error logs. Set it to <code class=\"language-text\">error</code> to only print errors.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">rotation</code></h4>\n<p>Tell Ghost to rotate your log files. By default Ghost keeps 10 log files and rotates every day. Rotation is enabled by default in production and disabled in development.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">transports</code></h4>\n<p>Define where Ghost should log to. By default Ghost writes to stdout and into file for production, and to stdout only for development.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">path</code></h4>\n<p>Log your content path, e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">content/logs/</code>. Set any path but ensure the permissions are correct to write into this folder.</p>\n<h3>Spam</h3>\n<p>Tell Ghost how to treat <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/config/defaults.json#L31\">spam requests</a>.</p>\n<h3>Caching</h3>\n<p>Configure <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/config/defaults.json#L57/\">caching</a> for sitemaps, redirects or assets.</p>\n<h3>Compress</h3>\n<p>The compression flag is turned on by default using <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;compress&quot;: true</code>. Alternatively you can turn it off with <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;compress&quot;: false</code>.</p>\n<h3>Image optimisation</h3>\n<p>When uploading images into the Ghost editor, they are automatically processed and compressed by default.

There are some configuration options which are required by default, and many optional configurations.</p>\n<p>The three required options are <code class=\"language-text\">url</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">database</code> which are configured during setup, and <code class=\"language-text\">mail</code> which needs to be configured once you've installed Ghost.</p>\n<p>This article explains how to setup your mail config, as well as walk you through all of the available config options.</p>\n<h2>Custom configuration files</h2>\n<p>The configuration is managed by <a href=\"https://github.com/indexzero/nconf/\">nconf</a>. A custom configuration file must be a valid JSON file located in the root folder and changes to the file can be implemented using <code class=\"language-text\">ghost restart</code>.</p>\n<p>Since Node.js has the concept of environments built in, Ghost supports two environments: <strong>development</strong> and <strong>production</strong>. All public Ghost publications run in production mode, while development mode can be used to test or build on top of Ghost locally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Check out the official install guides for <a href=\"/install/local/\">development</a> and <a href=\"/install/ubuntu/\">production</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The configuration files reflect the environment you are using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">config.development.json</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">config.production.json</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Ghost in development</h4>\n<p>If you would like to start Ghost in development, you don't have to specify any environment, because development is default. To test Ghost in production, you can use:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">NODE_ENV<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>production node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h4>Debugging the configuration output</h4>\n<p>Start Ghost with:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">DEBUG<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>ghost:*,ghost-config node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h4>Running Ghost with config env variables</h4>\n<p>Start Ghost using environment variables which match the name and case of each config option:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">url<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>http://ghost.local:2368 node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<p>For nested config options, separate with two underscores:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">database__connection__host<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>mysql node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Configuration options</h2>\n<p>There are a number of configuration options which are explained in detail in this article. Below is an index of all configuration options:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Required?</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">url</code></td>\n<td>In production</td>\n<td>Set the public URL for your blog</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">database</code></td>\n<td>In production</td>\n<td>Type of databased used (default: sqlite3)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">mail</code></td>\n<td>In production</td>\n<td>Add a mail service</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">admin</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Set the protocol and hostname for your admin panel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">server</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Host and port, or socket for Ghost to listen on</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">privacy</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Disable features set in <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/PRIVACY.md/\">privacy.md</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">paths</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Customise internal paths</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">referrerPolicy</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Control the content attribute of the meta referrer tag</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">useMinFiles</code></td>\n<td>Optionl</td>\n<td>Generate assets url with .min notation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">storage</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Set a custom storage adapter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">scheduling</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Set a custom scheduling adapter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">logging</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure logging for Ghost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">spam</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure spam settings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">caching</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure caching settings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">compress</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Disable compression of server responses</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">imageOptimization</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure image manipulation and processing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>URL</h3>\n<p><em>(Required in production)</em></p>\n<p>Once a Ghost publication is installed, the first thing to do is set a url. When installing using <code class=\"language-text\">ghost-cli</code> the install process request the URL during the setup process.</p>\n<p>Enter the URL that is used to access your publication. If using a subpath, enter the full path, <code class=\"language-text\">https://example.com/blog/</code>. If using SSL, always enter the URL with <code class=\"language-text\">https://</code>.</p>\n<h4>SSL</h4>\n<p>We always recommend using SSL to run your Ghost publication in production. Ghost has a number of configuration options for working with SSL, and securing the URLs for the admin <code class=\"language-text\">/ghost/</code> and the frontend of your publication. Without SSL your username and password are sent in plaintext.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ghost-cli</code> prompts to setup SSL during the installation process. After a successful ssl setup, you can find your ssl certificate in <code class=\"language-text\">/etc/letsencrypt</code>.</p>\n<p>If you see errors such as <code class=\"language-text\">access denied from url</code>, then the provided URL in your config file is incorrect and needs to be updated.</p>\n<h3>Database</h3>\n<p><em>(Required in production)</em></p>\n<p>Ghost is configured using MySQL by default:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"mysql\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"127.0.0.1\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">3306</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_user\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"password\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_password\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_name\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Alternatively you can configure sqlite3:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"sqlite3\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"filename\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"content/data/ghost-test.db\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"useNullAsDefault\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"debug\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>Number of connections</h4>\n<p>It's possible to limit the number of simultaneous connections using the pool setting. The default values are a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 10, which means Ghost always maintains two active database connections. You can set the minimum to 0 to prevent this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> ...<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> ... <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"pool\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"min\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"max\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">20</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>SSL</h4>\n<p>In a typical Ghost installation the MySQL database will be on the same server as Ghost itself. With cloud computing and database-as-a-service providers you might want to enable SSL connections to the database.</p>\n<p>If your Certificate CA or the CA of your database provider is in the Mozilla trusted CA list you can enable SSL by adding <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;ssl&quot;: true</code> to the database connection configuration:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"mysql\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_cloud_database\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">3306</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_user\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"password\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_password\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_name\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"ssl\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This has been confirmed to work with Azure Database for MySQL.

Mail configuration allows Ghost to send emails such as lost password and user invite emails.</p>\n<p>Ghost uses <a href=\"https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/tree/0.7/\">Nodemailer 0.7</a> under the hood, and tries to use the direct mail service if available - but a more reliable solution is to setup mail using an external service.</p>\n<h4>Setup an email sending account</h4>\n<p>Choose an external email service and sign up and verify your account. We highly recommend using <a href=\"https://www.mailgun.com/\">Mailgun</a> which allows up to 10,000 emails per month for free.</p>\n<h4>Configure mail with Mailgun</h4>\n<p>Mailgun allows you to use your own domain for sending transactional emails. Otherwise you can use a subdomain that Mailgun provide you with (also known as the sandbox domain, limited to 300 emails per day). You can change this at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>Make a note of your domain information</strong></p>\n<p>Once your domain is setup, find your new email service SMTP username and password that has been created for you (this is not the ones you used to sign up for Mailgun with). You can find this under \"Domain Information\" and make a note of the following details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Default SMTP login</li>\n<li>Default password</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Update your <code class=\"language-text\">config.production.json</code> file</h4>\n<p>Open your production config file in any code editor and paste the username and password you just copied into the defined fields, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"transport\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SMTP\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"options\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"service\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Mailgun\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"auth\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"postmaster@example.mailgun.org\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"pass\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"1234567890\"</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Once you are finished, hit save and then run <code class=\"language-text\">restart ghost</code> for your changes to take effect. It is possible to reuse your settings for a development environment if you have both, by making the same changes to <code class=\"language-text\">config.development.json</code>.</p>\n<h4>Amazon SES</h4>\n<p>It's also possible to use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ses/\">Amazon Simple Email Service</a>. Use the SMTP username and password given when signing up and configure your <code class=\"language-text\">config.[env].json</code> file as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"transport\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SMTP\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"options\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-SERVER-NAME\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">465</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"service\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SES\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"auth\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-ACCESS-KEY-ID\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"pass\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY\"</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>From address</h4>\n<p>By default the 'from' address for mail sent from Ghost is set to the title of your publication, for example <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;ghost@your-publication.com&gt;</code>. To override this to something different, use:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"from\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"myemail@address.com\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>A custom name can also be provided:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"from\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"'Custom Name' &lt;myemail@address.com>\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>Admin URL</h3>\n<p>Admin can be used to specify a different protocol for your admin panel or a different hostname (domain name). It can't affect the path at which the admin panel is served (this is always /ghost/).</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"admin\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"url\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"http://example.com\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>Server</h3>\n<p>The server host and port are the IP address and port number that Ghost listens on for requests. By default, requests are routed from port 80 to Ghost by nginx (recommended), or apache.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"server\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"127.0.0.1\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">2368</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>Unix Sockets</h4>\n<p>Ghost can also be configured to listen on a unix socket by changing the server config:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"server\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"socket\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"path/to/socket.sock\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The default permissions are 0660, but this can be configured by expanding the socket config:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"server\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"socket\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"path\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"path/to/socket.sock\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"permissions\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"0666\"</span>\n   <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>Privacy</h3>\n<p>All features inside the privacy.md file are enabled by default. It is possible to turn these off in order to protect privacy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update check</li>\n<li>Gravatar</li>\n<li>RPC ping</li>\n<li>Structured data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information about the features, read the <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/PRIVACY.md/\">privacy.md page</a>.</p>\n<p>To turn off <strong>all</strong> of the features, use:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"privacy\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"useTinfoil\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Alternatively, configure each feature individually:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"privacy\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"useUpdateCheck\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"useGravatar\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"useRpcPing\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"useStructuredData\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>Paths</h3>\n<p>The configuration of paths can be relative or absolute. To use a content directory that does not live inside the Ghost folder, specify a paths object with a new contentPath:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"paths\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"contentPath\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"content/\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>When using a custom content path, the content directory must exist and contain sub directories for data, images, themes, logs and adapters.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If using an Sqlite database, you'll also need to update the path to your database to match the new location of the data folder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Referrer Policy</h3>\n<p>Set the value of the content attribute of the meta referrer HTML tag by adding referrerPolicy to your config. <code class=\"language-text\">origin-when-crossorigin</code> is default. Read through all possible <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy/#referrer-policies/\">options</a>.</p>\n<h3>Logging</h3>\n<p>Configure how Ghost should log, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"logging\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"path\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"something/\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"level\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"info\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"rotation\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"enabled\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"count\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"period\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"1d\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"transports\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"stdout\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"file\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">level</code></h4>\n<p>The default log level is <code class=\"language-text\">info</code> which prints all info, warning and error logs. Set it to <code class=\"language-text\">error</code> to only print errors.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">rotation</code></h4>\n<p>Tell Ghost to rotate your log files. By default Ghost keeps 10 log files and rotates every day. Rotation is enabled by default in production and disabled in development.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">transports</code></h4>\n<p>Define where Ghost should log to. By default Ghost writes to stdout and into file for production, and to stdout only for development.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">path</code></h4>\n<p>Log your content path, e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">content/logs/</code>. Set any path but ensure the permissions are correct to write into this folder.</p>\n<h3>Spam</h3>\n<p>Tell Ghost how to treat <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/config/defaults.json#L31\">spam requests</a>.</p>\n<h3>Caching</h3>\n<p>Configure <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/config/defaults.json#L57/\">caching</a> for sitemaps, redirects or assets.</p>\n<h3>Compress</h3>\n<p>The compression flag is turned on by default using <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;compress&quot;: true</code>. Alternatively you can turn it off with <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;compress&quot;: false</code>.</p>\n<h3>Image optimisation</h3>\n<p>When uploading images into the Ghost editor, they are automatically processed and compressed by default. This can be disabled in your <code class=\"language-text\">config.[env].json</code> file using:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"imageOptimization\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"resize\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Image compression details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resize the image to 2000px max width</li>\n<li>JPEG's are compressed to 80% quality.</li>\n<li>Meta data removed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The original image is kept with the suffix <code class=\"language-text\">_0</code>.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>You've explored how to configure a self-hosted Ghost publication with the required config options, as well as discovered how to make use of the optional config options that are available in the <code class=\"language-text\">config.[env].json</code> file.</p>\n<p>If you run into any issues when configuring your publication, try searching this site to find information about common error messages and issues.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-12-27","path":"/post-12-27","title":"Post 12 27","tags":["DirectX 12","C++"],"type":"resource","typeID":"3","typeTitle":"资源","categores":"游戏","special":""}}},{"node":{"id":"804e75c9-527a-5fcf-9ed8-b5f1b73e27ef","excerpt":"Overview When you install Ghost using the supported and recommended method using  , a custom configuration file is created for you by default.

There are some configuration options which are required by default, and many optional configurations.</p>\n<p>The three required options are <code class=\"language-text\">url</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">database</code> which are configured during setup, and <code class=\"language-text\">mail</code> which needs to be configured once you've installed Ghost.</p>\n<p>This article explains how to setup your mail config, as well as walk you through all of the available config options.</p>\n<h2>Custom configuration files</h2>\n<p>The configuration is managed by <a href=\"https://github.com/indexzero/nconf/\">nconf</a>. A custom configuration file must be a valid JSON file located in the root folder and changes to the file can be implemented using <code class=\"language-text\">ghost restart</code>.</p>\n<p>Since Node.js has the concept of environments built in, Ghost supports two environments: <strong>development</strong> and <strong>production</strong>. All public Ghost publications run in production mode, while development mode can be used to test or build on top of Ghost locally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Check out the official install guides for <a href=\"/install/local/\">development</a> and <a href=\"/install/ubuntu/\">production</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The configuration files reflect the environment you are using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">config.development.json</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">config.production.json</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Ghost in development</h4>\n<p>If you would like to start Ghost in development, you don't have to specify any environment, because development is default. To test Ghost in production, you can use:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">NODE_ENV<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>production node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h4>Debugging the configuration output</h4>\n<p>Start Ghost with:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">DEBUG<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>ghost:*,ghost-config node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h4>Running Ghost with config env variables</h4>\n<p>Start Ghost using environment variables which match the name and case of each config option:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">url<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>http://ghost.local:2368 node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<p>For nested config options, separate with two underscores:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">database__connection__host<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>mysql node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Configuration options</h2>\n<p>There are a number of configuration options which are explained in detail in this article. Below is an index of all configuration options:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Required?</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">url</code></td>\n<td>In production</td>\n<td>Set the public URL for your blog</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">database</code></td>\n<td>In production</td>\n<td>Type of databased used (default: sqlite3)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">mail</code></td>\n<td>In production</td>\n<td>Add a mail service</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">admin</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Set the protocol and hostname for your admin panel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">server</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Host and port, or socket for Ghost to listen on</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">privacy</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Disable features set in <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/PRIVACY.md/\">privacy.md</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">paths</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Customise internal paths</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">referrerPolicy</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Control the content attribute of the meta referrer tag</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">useMinFiles</code></td>\n<td>Optionl</td>\n<td>Generate assets url with .min notation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">storage</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Set a custom storage adapter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">scheduling</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Set a custom scheduling adapter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">logging</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure logging for Ghost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">spam</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure spam settings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">caching</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure caching settings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">compress</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Disable compression of server responses</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">imageOptimization</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure image manipulation and processing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>URL</h3>\n<p><em>(Required in production)</em></p>\n<p>Once a Ghost publication is installed, the first thing to do is set a url. When installing using <code class=\"language-text\">ghost-cli</code> the install process request the URL during the setup process.</p>\n<p>Enter the URL that is used to access your publication. If using a subpath, enter the full path, <code class=\"language-text\">https://example.com/blog/</code>. If using SSL, always enter the URL with <code class=\"language-text\">https://</code>.</p>\n<h4>SSL</h4>\n<p>We always recommend using SSL to run your Ghost publication in production. Ghost has a number of configuration options for working with SSL, and securing the URLs for the admin <code class=\"language-text\">/ghost/</code> and the frontend of your publication. Without SSL your username and password are sent in plaintext.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ghost-cli</code> prompts to setup SSL during the installation process. After a successful ssl setup, you can find your ssl certificate in <code class=\"language-text\">/etc/letsencrypt</code>.</p>\n<p>If you see errors such as <code class=\"language-text\">access denied from url</code>, then the provided URL in your config file is incorrect and needs to be updated.</p>\n<h3>Database</h3>\n<p><em>(Required in production)</em></p>\n<p>Ghost is configured using MySQL by default:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"mysql\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"127.0.0.1\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">3306</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_user\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"password\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_password\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_name\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Alternatively you can configure sqlite3:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"sqlite3\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"filename\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"content/data/ghost-test.db\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"useNullAsDefault\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"debug\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>Number of connections</h4>\n<p>It's possible to limit the number of simultaneous connections using the pool setting. The default values are a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 10, which means Ghost always maintains two active database connections. You can set the minimum to 0 to prevent this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> ...<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> ... <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"pool\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"min\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"max\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">20</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>SSL</h4>\n<p>In a typical Ghost installation the MySQL database will be on the same server as Ghost itself. With cloud computing and database-as-a-service providers you might want to enable SSL connections to the database.</p>\n<p>If your Certificate CA or the CA of your database provider is in the Mozilla trusted CA list you can enable SSL by adding <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;ssl&quot;: true</code> to the database connection configuration:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"mysql\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_cloud_database\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">3306</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_user\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"password\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_password\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_name\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"ssl\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This has been confirmed to work with Azure Database for MySQL.

Mail configuration allows Ghost to send emails such as lost password and user invite emails.</p>\n<p>Ghost uses <a href=\"https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/tree/0.7/\">Nodemailer 0.7</a> under the hood, and tries to use the direct mail service if available - but a more reliable solution is to setup mail using an external service.</p>\n<h4>Setup an email sending account</h4>\n<p>Choose an external email service and sign up and verify your account. We highly recommend using <a href=\"https://www.mailgun.com/\">Mailgun</a> which allows up to 10,000 emails per month for free.</p>\n<h4>Configure mail with Mailgun</h4>\n<p>Mailgun allows you to use your own domain for sending transactional emails. Otherwise you can use a subdomain that Mailgun provide you with (also known as the sandbox domain, limited to 300 emails per day). You can change this at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>Make a note of your domain information</strong></p>\n<p>Once your domain is setup, find your new email service SMTP username and password that has been created for you (this is not the ones you used to sign up for Mailgun with). You can find this under \"Domain Information\" and make a note of the following details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Default SMTP login</li>\n<li>Default password</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Update your <code class=\"language-text\">config.production.json</code> file</h4>\n<p>Open your production config file in any code editor and paste the username and password you just copied into the defined fields, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"transport\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SMTP\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"options\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"service\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Mailgun\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"auth\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"postmaster@example.mailgun.org\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"pass\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"1234567890\"</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Once you are finished, hit save and then run <code class=\"language-text\">restart ghost</code> for your changes to take effect. It is possible to reuse your settings for a development environment if you have both, by making the same changes to <code class=\"language-text\">config.development.json</code>.</p>\n<h4>Amazon SES</h4>\n<p>It's also possible to use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ses/\">Amazon Simple Email Service</a>. Use the SMTP username and password given when signing up and configure your <code class=\"language-text\">config.[env].json</code> file as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"transport\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SMTP\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"options\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-SERVER-NAME\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">465</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"service\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SES\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"auth\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-ACCESS-KEY-ID\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"pass\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY\"</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>From address</h4>\n<p>By default the 'from' address for mail sent from Ghost is set to the title of your publication, for example <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;ghost@your-publication.com&gt;</code>. To override this to something different, use:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"from\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"myemail@address.com\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>A custom name can also be provided:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"from\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"'Custom Name' &lt;myemail@address.com>\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>Admin URL</h3>\n<p>Admin can be used to specify a different protocol for your admin panel or a different hostname (domain name).

To use a content directory that does not live inside the Ghost folder, specify a paths object with a new contentPath:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"paths\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"contentPath\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"content/\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>When using a custom content path, the content directory must exist and contain sub directories for data, images, themes, logs and adapters.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If using an Sqlite database, you'll also need to update the path to your database to match the new location of the data folder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Referrer Policy</h3>\n<p>Set the value of the content attribute of the meta referrer HTML tag by adding referrerPolicy to your config. <code class=\"language-text\">origin-when-crossorigin</code> is default. Read through all possible <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy/#referrer-policies/\">options</a>.</p>\n<h3>Logging</h3>\n<p>Configure how Ghost should log, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"logging\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"path\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"something/\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"level\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"info\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"rotation\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"enabled\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"count\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"period\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"1d\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"transports\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"stdout\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"file\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">level</code></h4>\n<p>The default log level is <code class=\"language-text\">info</code> which prints all info, warning and error logs. Set it to <code class=\"language-text\">error</code> to only print errors.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">rotation</code></h4>\n<p>Tell Ghost to rotate your log files. By default Ghost keeps 10 log files and rotates every day. Rotation is enabled by default in production and disabled in development.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">transports</code></h4>\n<p>Define where Ghost should log to. By default Ghost writes to stdout and into file for production, and to stdout only for development.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">path</code></h4>\n<p>Log your content path, e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">content/logs/</code>. Set any path but ensure the permissions are correct to write into this folder.</p>\n<h3>Spam</h3>\n<p>Tell Ghost how to treat <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/config/defaults.json#L31\">spam requests</a>.</p>\n<h3>Caching</h3>\n<p>Configure <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/config/defaults.json#L57/\">caching</a> for sitemaps, redirects or assets.</p>\n<h3>Compress</h3>\n<p>The compression flag is turned on by default using <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;compress&quot;: true</code>. Alternatively you can turn it off with <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;compress&quot;: false</code>.</p>\n<h3>Image optimisation</h3>\n<p>When uploading images into the Ghost editor, they are automatically processed and compressed by default.

There are some configuration options which are required by default, and many optional configurations.</p>\n<p>The three required options are <code class=\"language-text\">url</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">database</code> which are configured during setup, and <code class=\"language-text\">mail</code> which needs to be configured once you've installed Ghost.</p>\n<p>This article explains how to setup your mail config, as well as walk you through all of the available config options.</p>\n<h2>Custom configuration files</h2>\n<p>The configuration is managed by <a href=\"https://github.com/indexzero/nconf/\">nconf</a>. A custom configuration file must be a valid JSON file located in the root folder and changes to the file can be implemented using <code class=\"language-text\">ghost restart</code>.</p>\n<p>Since Node.js has the concept of environments built in, Ghost supports two environments: <strong>development</strong> and <strong>production</strong>. All public Ghost publications run in production mode, while development mode can be used to test or build on top of Ghost locally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Check out the official install guides for <a href=\"/install/local/\">development</a> and <a href=\"/install/ubuntu/\">production</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The configuration files reflect the environment you are using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">config.development.json</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">config.production.json</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Ghost in development</h4>\n<p>If you would like to start Ghost in development, you don't have to specify any environment, because development is default. To test Ghost in production, you can use:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">NODE_ENV<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>production node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h4>Debugging the configuration output</h4>\n<p>Start Ghost with:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">DEBUG<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>ghost:*,ghost-config node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h4>Running Ghost with config env variables</h4>\n<p>Start Ghost using environment variables which match the name and case of each config option:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">url<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>http://ghost.local:2368 node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<p>For nested config options, separate with two underscores:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">database__connection__host<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>mysql node index.js</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Configuration options</h2>\n<p>There are a number of configuration options which are explained in detail in this article. Below is an index of all configuration options:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Required?</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">url</code></td>\n<td>In production</td>\n<td>Set the public URL for your blog</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">database</code></td>\n<td>In production</td>\n<td>Type of databased used (default: sqlite3)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">mail</code></td>\n<td>In production</td>\n<td>Add a mail service</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">admin</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Set the protocol and hostname for your admin panel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">server</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Host and port, or socket for Ghost to listen on</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">privacy</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Disable features set in <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/PRIVACY.md/\">privacy.md</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">paths</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Customise internal paths</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">referrerPolicy</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Control the content attribute of the meta referrer tag</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">useMinFiles</code></td>\n<td>Optionl</td>\n<td>Generate assets url with .min notation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">storage</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Set a custom storage adapter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">scheduling</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Set a custom scheduling adapter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">logging</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure logging for Ghost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">spam</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure spam settings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">caching</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure caching settings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">compress</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Disable compression of server responses</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">imageOptimization</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Configure image manipulation and processing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>URL</h3>\n<p><em>(Required in production)</em></p>\n<p>Once a Ghost publication is installed, the first thing to do is set a url. When installing using <code class=\"language-text\">ghost-cli</code> the install process request the URL during the setup process.</p>\n<p>Enter the URL that is used to access your publication. If using a subpath, enter the full path, <code class=\"language-text\">https://example.com/blog/</code>. If using SSL, always enter the URL with <code class=\"language-text\">https://</code>.</p>\n<h4>SSL</h4>\n<p>We always recommend using SSL to run your Ghost publication in production. Ghost has a number of configuration options for working with SSL, and securing the URLs for the admin <code class=\"language-text\">/ghost/</code> and the frontend of your publication. Without SSL your username and password are sent in plaintext.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ghost-cli</code> prompts to setup SSL during the installation process. After a successful ssl setup, you can find your ssl certificate in <code class=\"language-text\">/etc/letsencrypt</code>.</p>\n<p>If you see errors such as <code class=\"language-text\">access denied from url</code>, then the provided URL in your config file is incorrect and needs to be updated.</p>\n<h3>Database</h3>\n<p><em>(Required in production)</em></p>\n<p>Ghost is configured using MySQL by default:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"mysql\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"127.0.0.1\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">3306</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_user\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"password\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_password\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_name\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Alternatively you can configure sqlite3:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"sqlite3\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"filename\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"content/data/ghost-test.db\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"useNullAsDefault\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"debug\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>Number of connections</h4>\n<p>It's possible to limit the number of simultaneous connections using the pool setting. The default values are a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 10, which means Ghost always maintains two active database connections. You can set the minimum to 0 to prevent this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> ...<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> ... <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"pool\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"min\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"max\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">20</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>SSL</h4>\n<p>In a typical Ghost installation the MySQL database will be on the same server as Ghost itself. With cloud computing and database-as-a-service providers you might want to enable SSL connections to the database.</p>\n<p>If your Certificate CA or the CA of your database provider is in the Mozilla trusted CA list you can enable SSL by adding <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;ssl&quot;: true</code> to the database connection configuration:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"client\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"mysql\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"connection\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_cloud_database\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">3306</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_user\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"password\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_password\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"database\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"your_database_name\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"ssl\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This has been confirmed to work with Azure Database for MySQL.

Mail configuration allows Ghost to send emails such as lost password and user invite emails.</p>\n<p>Ghost uses <a href=\"https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/tree/0.7/\">Nodemailer 0.7</a> under the hood, and tries to use the direct mail service if available - but a more reliable solution is to setup mail using an external service.</p>\n<h4>Setup an email sending account</h4>\n<p>Choose an external email service and sign up and verify your account. We highly recommend using <a href=\"https://www.mailgun.com/\">Mailgun</a> which allows up to 10,000 emails per month for free.</p>\n<h4>Configure mail with Mailgun</h4>\n<p>Mailgun allows you to use your own domain for sending transactional emails. Otherwise you can use a subdomain that Mailgun provide you with (also known as the sandbox domain, limited to 300 emails per day). You can change this at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>Make a note of your domain information</strong></p>\n<p>Once your domain is setup, find your new email service SMTP username and password that has been created for you (this is not the ones you used to sign up for Mailgun with). You can find this under \"Domain Information\" and make a note of the following details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Default SMTP login</li>\n<li>Default password</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Update your <code class=\"language-text\">config.production.json</code> file</h4>\n<p>Open your production config file in any code editor and paste the username and password you just copied into the defined fields, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"transport\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SMTP\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"options\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"service\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Mailgun\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"auth\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"postmaster@example.mailgun.org\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"pass\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"1234567890\"</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Once you are finished, hit save and then run <code class=\"language-text\">restart ghost</code> for your changes to take effect. It is possible to reuse your settings for a development environment if you have both, by making the same changes to <code class=\"language-text\">config.development.json</code>.</p>\n<h4>Amazon SES</h4>\n<p>It's also possible to use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ses/\">Amazon Simple Email Service</a>. Use the SMTP username and password given when signing up and configure your <code class=\"language-text\">config.[env].json</code> file as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"transport\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SMTP\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"options\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-SERVER-NAME\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">465</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"service\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"SES\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"auth\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"user\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-ACCESS-KEY-ID\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"token property\">\"pass\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"YOUR-SES-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY\"</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>From address</h4>\n<p>By default the 'from' address for mail sent from Ghost is set to the title of your publication, for example <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;ghost@your-publication.com&gt;</code>. To override this to something different, use:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"from\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"myemail@address.com\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>A custom name can also be provided:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"mail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"from\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"'Custom Name' &lt;myemail@address.com>\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>Admin URL</h3>\n<p>Admin can be used to specify a different protocol for your admin panel or a different hostname (domain name).

By default, requests are routed from port 80 to Ghost by nginx (recommended), or apache.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"server\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"host\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"127.0.0.1\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"port\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">2368</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>Unix Sockets</h4>\n<p>Ghost can also be configured to listen on a unix socket by changing the server config:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"server\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"socket\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"path/to/socket.sock\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The default permissions are 0660, but this can be configured by expanding the socket config:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"server\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"socket\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"path\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"path/to/socket.sock\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"permissions\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"0666\"</span>\n   <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>Privacy</h3>\n<p>All features inside the privacy.md file are enabled by default. It is possible to turn these off in order to protect privacy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update check</li>\n<li>Gravatar</li>\n<li>RPC ping</li>\n<li>Structured data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information about the features, read the <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/PRIVACY.md/\">privacy.md page</a>.</p>\n<p>To turn off <strong>all</strong> of the features, use:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"privacy\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"useTinfoil\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Alternatively, configure each feature individually:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"privacy\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"useUpdateCheck\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"useGravatar\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"useRpcPing\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"useStructuredData\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>Paths</h3>\n<p>The configuration of paths can be relative or absolute. To use a content directory that does not live inside the Ghost folder, specify a paths object with a new contentPath:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"paths\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"contentPath\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"content/\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>When using a custom content path, the content directory must exist and contain sub directories for data, images, themes, logs and adapters.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If using an Sqlite database, you'll also need to update the path to your database to match the new location of the data folder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Referrer Policy</h3>\n<p>Set the value of the content attribute of the meta referrer HTML tag by adding referrerPolicy to your config. <code class=\"language-text\">origin-when-crossorigin</code> is default. Read through all possible <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy/#referrer-policies/\">options</a>.</p>\n<h3>Logging</h3>\n<p>Configure how Ghost should log, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"logging\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"path\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"something/\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"level\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"info\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"rotation\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"enabled\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"count\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"period\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"1d\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"transports\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"stdout\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"file\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">level</code></h4>\n<p>The default log level is <code class=\"language-text\">info</code> which prints all info, warning and error logs. Set it to <code class=\"language-text\">error</code> to only print errors.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">rotation</code></h4>\n<p>Tell Ghost to rotate your log files. By default Ghost keeps 10 log files and rotates every day. Rotation is enabled by default in production and disabled in development.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">transports</code></h4>\n<p>Define where Ghost should log to. By default Ghost writes to stdout and into file for production, and to stdout only for development.</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">path</code></h4>\n<p>Log your content path, e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">content/logs/</code>. Set any path but ensure the permissions are correct to write into this folder.</p>\n<h3>Spam</h3>\n<p>Tell Ghost how to treat <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/config/defaults.json#L31\">spam requests</a>.</p>\n<h3>Caching</h3>\n<p>Configure <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/config/defaults.json#L57/\">caching</a> for sitemaps, redirects or assets.</p>\n<h3>Compress</h3>\n<p>The compression flag is turned on by default using <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;compress&quot;: true</code>. Alternatively you can turn it off with <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;compress&quot;: false</code>.</p>\n<h3>Image optimisation</h3>\n<p>When uploading images into the Ghost editor, they are automatically processed and compressed by default. This can be disabled in your <code class=\"language-text\">config.[env].json</code> file using:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"imageOptimization\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token
